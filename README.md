Visor is a magnifying glass for your iPhone, iPad and iPod touch.

your magnified content to your TV and VoiceOver.

During the day, there is a lot printed text to read:

- restaurant menus,
- price tags,
- the newspaper,
- letters or
- photos from your loved ones

visor zooms and improves the contrast of whatever you want to see.
Its advanced color modes and simple interface are made for giving
you the best possible perception of printed text on your screen
like you'd expect it from a handheld electronic magnifier.
